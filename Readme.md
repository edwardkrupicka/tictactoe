### Features

#### On the TicTacToe site, the user can:


  * Play some good old fashioned Tic Tac Toe!

  * Player scores are displayed under their icon and are pushed to local storage so it persits on page reload.

  * Board times out and clears after a round is completed.

  * Press the 'Start New Game' button and it clears local storage and resets the game board.

  * Last but not least a hidden but not so hidden feature.

### Wins
* The CSS! I had a lot of fun playing with the CSS this project. Figuring out how to use Flex Box and get everything to resize properly was a fun challenge. I have grown alot since the beginning of Mod 1 and this being a solo project I had a lot of creative freedom!

* Creating the win conditional method in my game.js. It's feels very dynamic for my level and it took a lot of time to get up and running.

### Challenges
* Starting! I did not know where to start when this project was assigned to me. At first I just put a lot of my functionality in my main.js and worked from there. Eventually I did start to understand where I needed to place my DOM manipulation and what type of methods needed to go in my game class and player class. 

* Fixing random bugs at one in the morning. Coding till the late hours of the night proved to waste more time than solve issues. Eventually I started coding in the morning and realized I am much more productive after a good nights rest.

* Creating my win conditional took a lot of trial and error. I had no idea how to approach it at first and knew I couldn't get very far until I made it past that obstacle.

### Bugs

* `Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received.` I recieve this little error in my dev console every time I open my webpage and it never goes away.

### Future Goals
* Get that darn runtime.lastError to go away.

* Play a fun sound everytime a player wins.

* Implement a secret function that runs when either player score reaches an unspecified number.

* Build a function that predicts a draw.
